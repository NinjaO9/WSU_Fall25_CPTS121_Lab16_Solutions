* STUDENT GUIDE -
*
*	Andy may not have gone over functions yet in class; but I am using functions in my solution to easily separate tasks
*	To find my solutions for individual tasks, look into the GeneralLab1.c file, each task is split into their own function, with ALOT of comments to help explain what is happening
*	If you have any questions about the code, feel free to reach out to me (my email should be an a canvas announcement for the lab)!
